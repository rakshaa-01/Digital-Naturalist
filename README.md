Digital Naturalist - AI Enabled tool for Biodiversity Researchers


Project overview:

    A naturalist is someone who observes natural patterns and recognises various flora and fauna in the wild. Field naturalists frequently rely on conventional strategies when exploring the woods, such as always bringing a guidebook with them or asking knowledgeable ornithologists for assistance. They ought to have access to a useful tool that allows them to notice, catalog, and communicate the beauty to others. To identify the birds, flowers, animals, and other species they see on their treks, canoe journeys, and other excursions, field naturalists can utilize this web app from anywhere.
In this project we will be collecting images and information about different flora and fauna  and training a deep learning model to predict the species for the given image using a web application.

Purpose:
    
    The purpose of this project is to create a web application which consists of information about different flora and fauna which will serve as a guide for digital naturalists on their hikes. This can be used by many naturalists, archaeologists, ecologists, biologists, other scientists and curious laymen to reduce the time of identification of the species and progress with their research or work. Society of Scientists, researchers, knowledge seekers or students can attract better. This will help ease the work of digital naturalists.
